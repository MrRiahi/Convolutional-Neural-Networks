# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this repository, I build different image classification CNN models from scratch and train on different datasets. 
Results and codes will be updated in the future. These models are ResNet50 and MobileNetV1. In the future, this 
repository will be updated with other neural networks.

# TODO
- [ ] Train reliable MobileNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet models
- [x] Add evaluation 
- [x] Add Inference
- [ ] Convert models to tf-lite
- [ ] Convert  models to Onnx
- [ ] Inference with tf-lite
